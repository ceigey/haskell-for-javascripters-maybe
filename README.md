# haskell-for-javascripters-maybe
Somewhere between a guide to Haskell and FP for people used to things like JavaScript and Python, and a journal as I attempt to understand these things myself.

## Introduction
The goal of this repository is to collect information about Functional Programming, especially from the POV of Haskell and PureScript, and relate it to things that I find to be useful analogies in the JavaScripty, Pythonic world I find familiar.
